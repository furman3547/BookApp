Once hearing about the movie, i told myself that I would read it before the movie released. I woke up today realizing that was today- and started it this morning. I finished it tonight.  These are some thoughts that i communicated to my best friends immediately after giving 5 stars to this book that i just assumed (incorrectly) that i would dislike. I HAVE NOT SEEN THE FILM YET- again SPOILERS AHEAD for the NOVEL. <br/><br/>I loved that Tate was the only one who knew. <br/>I love that she had a motive but wouldn’t have been respected if she claimed self defense because she was the “marsh girl” I love how it highlighted isolation and finding peace in small things.  <br/>I love how the author explained loneliness that you nearly rely on EVERY TINY interaction to get by. That even a small conversation is okay for a few days- but if she didn’t have the interaction, she backslid. It reminded me of how much everyone needs someone. <br/>No matter how many people left her, only one came back. She had her guard up- but it was struck down by being honest with only one person- the only person she ever loved. She was strong to defend herself against Chase, and weak for not being able to participate in the privileged society- but that did not matter, Tate saw her for her potential- and even though he could have been exiled from the community for being so close to her, he was the only one- the only one- who believed she could be more than what everyone else said she was.<br/>even when she didn’t believe it herself. <br/><br/>Anyways, that was more of a brain dump than a formal review but- hey- for what it’s worth I’m elated that I read this novel, and I understand the hype now.

For anyone who has been through, really, .. anything- this book is for you. Hope courage, and heartwarming chapters. The heroine is so unlikely- she is like no other character I’ve read before. Honeyman’s realistic view of the world through Eleanor’s eyes is charming. <br/><br/>Beautifully paced writing , and meaningful dialogue brings you to a surprising twist- but oddly enough- it is a grain of salt when compared to the true meaning of Eleanor’s story- hope and recovery. <br/><br/>All awhile she’s looking for a way out, she makes it out in an unlikely way with the help of an unlikely friend. Gladly, and for a nice change- it is not a love story- but one of companionship and healing. <br/><br/>Witty, charming, and delightful- Eleanor will stay with me forever.",,,1,0
